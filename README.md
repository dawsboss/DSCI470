# DSCI470
Data Science Capstone

##Authors: Grant Dawson and Ryan Rosiak

#### 
###    Project 1: The student will select a data set and will develop research questions based on preliminary visualization/statistical analysis of the data, preferably using Python (Jupyter) or another modern scientific programming language. They will collect resources relevant to the data set and research questions, and will present the following (
    * (a) Data set description and management plan. 
    * (b) Research questions and preliminary exploratory analysis. 
    * (c) Annotated bibliography.
###    Project 2: (follow-up from project 1) The student will analyze their data and focus on the research questions, exploring methods from their literature review and focusing on one or two of them. The students should present a polished and defensible report at the end, and will present it to the class. This report should be readable by another undergraduate student in their field, meaning it should be technical but with a fair amount of exposition for the reader. They will summarize what research questions they were able to answer, where more exploration is needed, and how their original plans changed as they explored their data set.
###    Project 3: Each individual 3 student will select an advisor based on their DSCI track in the relevant department. Through short checkpoint discussions with potential advisor (2-3 meetings), they will select their project and prepare a proposal based on their experience in Project 1. Advisor approval on project 3 needed for student to pass and continue to DSCI 490.
